// Hereâ€™s the mile-high view of recursive backtracking:
// * Choose a starting point in the field.
// * Randomly choose a wall at that point and carve a passage through to the
//   adjacent cell, but only if the adjacent cell has not been visited yet.
//   This becomes the new current cell.
// * If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that
//   has uncarved walls and repeat.
// * The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the
//   starting point.
