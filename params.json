Built using jQuery and SVG with RaphaÃ«l.","body":"### Seneca.io Business Card Generator\r\n\r\nA couple years ago a friend generated a series of mazes for his new business cards (http://businesssavvysoftware.com/2010/09/01/business-cards/). I thought it was a cool idea.\r\nAt the time I asked if he was planning on open sourcing his business cards, the response: \"_Have you ever heard of open source business cards_\". Well, no actually. But let me be the first!\r\n\r\nThis repo houses the Seneca.io Business Card Generator scripts.\r\n\r\nThe Seneca.io logo is a hexagon, so I wanted to generate a hexagonal grid. Each cell within the grid can have it's sides open or closed, allowing a maze generator to create random paths within the grid."}
